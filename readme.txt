Create your WordPress site easier and faster directly in the Gutenberg Block Editor without coding using core blocks and block themes.

== Description ==

Content Blocks Builder (CBB) is a tool that helps you create **custom blocks**, **variations**, **styles**, and **patterns** directly in the **Block Editor** without using a **code editor**.

WordPress, with its Gutenberg Block Editor, provides a robust foundation for building websites. However, when you need something **more specific** or **unique** features that are not available in the default blocks, you have to build custom solutions or explore third-party options. CBB is designed to help you create those **unique layouts and features** easily, eliminating the need to seek out third-party plugins.

The core feature of CBB is to create custom blocks by grouping core blocks or third-party blocks into a container block. This container block offers native features such as typography, colors, spacing, border, etc., along with a bunch of custom advanced features that help you create common layouts such as **grid**, **carousel**, **accordion**, **modal**, **off-canvas**, etc. You can also create **repeater blocks** to display repeating content that works similarly to the ACF repeater field. For more information, please check out [the detailed guide about CBB blocks](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/documentation/custom-blocks/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB+Blocks).

The goal of CBB is to help you build a **complex website** with WordPress using only core blocks and native Gutenberg features with any block theme.

=== Key technical features ===

 - **Manage custom blocks**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete custom blocks.
 - **Create repeater blocks** that work similarly to ACF repeater fields. Supports carousel, grid, accordion and vertical stack layouts.

 - **Advanced block support features**: Modal, off-canvas, toggle content, sticky, responsive dimensions, spacing, custom attributes, reveal animations, etc.
 - **Manage block variations & block styles**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete block variations. It works on any block. [CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB) enables you to input custom CSS for variations.
 - **Manage block patterns**: Create, edit, copy, import, and delete custom block patterns.
 - **Enhance the Query Loop block**: Add grid, carousel layouts, and advanced filter and sorting settings. Works with any post types.
 - **Import/export** custom blocks, variations, and patterns from/to other sites
 - **Pre-built library**: A library of pre-built blocks, variations, styles, and patterns. This library is not bundled with CBB; only items you import appear on your site.
 - CBB are built with vanilla JS and CSS. It depends only [SwiperJs](https://swiperjs.com/) for the carousel script.

=== Practical features you can build with CBB ===

 - **Carousel layouts**: Ideal for creating banner slider, posts carousel, gallery, carousel of features or other repeating content, etc. CBB provides one of the best way to create a carousel layout in Gutenberg. Built on top of the popular SwiperJs carousel script, it supports extensive customization. [CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB) enables you to create entrance effects, advanced slide effects with effect builder, and further customization like slides per breakpoint, pagination, navigation, and synced carousels.
 - **Responsive grid layouts**: Perfect for creating equal column grid, mosaic grid, bento grid, posts grid, grid of features or other repeating content, etc. CBB provides the easiest but most flexible and robost grid layout based on CSS Grid layout. You can customize template columns, grid gaps, size, and location for each grid item.
 - **Accordion layouts**: Good for creating FAQ page, navigations, long features or specications.
 - **Blog page design, magazine layout, post grid, post carousel**; Work with any post types.
 - **Modal, off-canvas, popover, toggle content**: Great for creating popups, notification bars, toggle menu, toggle search box, hamburger menu, popover, show/hide content, etc. [CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB) allows you to add a custom entrance animation effect, delay to appear of the blocks, and save the closed state of blocks.
 - **Sticky content**: Great for fixed/sticky header, footer, floating elements, sticky sidebar. [CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB) enables you to style blocks based on their stuck state and make blocks sticky only when scrolling up.
 - **[[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)] Backgound effect**: Add parallax, infinite scrolling, and zooming effect to image easily. Perfect for hero section designs.

 - **[[CBB Pro](https://contentblocksbuilder.com/pro/?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=CBB+Upgrade&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)] Custom layout & style**: With the ability to enqueue external JS/CSS and input custom JS/CSS, you can do anything with your blocks on frontend.

For dynamic data, we recommend using the [Meta Field Block](https://metafieldblock.com) plugin. It's the best way to display dynamic data.

=== Why choose CBB? ===

 - It's **fast**, **clean**, **flexible** and **code-free**. It **uses core blocks** to build container blocks.
 - It's **bloat-free**. It doesnâ€™t come bundled with a ton of specific-use blocks like other multiple-feature plugins.
 - It's **easy to use**. It **adheres to Gutenberg** and maintain the primary user experience of Gutenberg, so anyone familiar with the Block Editor is already familiar with CBB.
 - Sites built with CBB are **easier to maintain** as most tasks are accomplished through the Block Editor. You don't need to know React to create complex blocks or maintain a code repository for them. You can also import/export them from/to other sites.

=== Which theme should I use with this plugin? ===
It is compatible with all Gutenberg-ready themes, but our recommended themes are default themes such as [Twenty Twenty Four](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentyfour/), [Twenty Twenty Three](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentythree/), [Twenty Twenty Two](https://wordpress.org/themes/twentytwentytwo/), or [Astra](https://wordpress.org/themes/astra/) theme.

=== How does it work with other blocks/plugins? ===
This plugin works with all third-party blocks but we recommend using single-block plugins for lightweight and performance. We also develop several single block plugins, that work great with this plugin, please see them in the below section.

=== Design library ===

We have already included a library of block patterns for you to quickly use or customize to fit your design. There is a popup inserter in the block editor for you to find and insert patterns with a few clicks.

[How to use the pattern inserter popup](https://youtu.be/UTrZSBvkzj0).

Browse the **[Design Library](https://boldpatterns.net?utm_source=wp.org&utm_campaign=readme&utm_medium=link&utm_content=CBB)** to see what the plugin can do for you.

=== Block and Variation library ===

Besides the pattern library, we have built an external library of content blocks and common block variations. All of the blocks/variations in this library have been created by CBB directly in the Block Editor. With a few clicks, you can easily import blocks or variations into your site. You use them directly or customize or learn from them.

Watch some video tutorials to learn how to use the library:

[Import the particles background block](https://youtu.be/BVvImhhZma4).
